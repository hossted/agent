# agent

The hossted agent will run as a kubernetes operator and upon explicit client request will send you're cluster data to the hossted management and support dashboard - see https://hossted.com

We will implement it as a kubernetes operator so it can send as much info as possible about the cluster , namespaces ,helmcharts, pods and images
